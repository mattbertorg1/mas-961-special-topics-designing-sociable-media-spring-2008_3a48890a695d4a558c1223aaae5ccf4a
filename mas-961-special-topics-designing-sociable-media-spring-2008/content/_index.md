This project-based course explores new design strategies for social interaction in the computer mediated world. Through weekly readings and design assignments we will examine topics such as:

*   Data-based portraiture
*   Depicting growth, change and the passage of time
*   Visualizing conversations, crowds, and networks
*   Interfaces for the connected city
*   Mobile social technologies

The course emphasizes developing visual and interactive literacy.
